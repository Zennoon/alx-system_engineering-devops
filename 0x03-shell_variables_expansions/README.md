This directory was created to hold my answers / submissions for the project '0x03. Shell, init files, variables, and expansion' of ALX SE foundations.

0-alias: The script uses the alias command to create an alias named ls executing the command 'rm *'

1-hello_you: The script uses the echo command with the USER reserved variable to print the name of the current user

2-path: The script uses the existing reserved variable PATH and appends :/action to it using double quoting which does not suppress parameter expansion
